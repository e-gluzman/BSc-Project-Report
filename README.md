# "A computational framework for the investigation of large-scale brain organisation"

This repository contains the report I wrote for the final project completed as part of the BSc Psychology course at the University of York. The framework has been co-developed with Dr. Tom Hartley. Tom provided most of the code for the framework, I created the simulation scripts and implemented the cosine similarity function.

The goal of the presented framework is to model the emergence of large-scale structure in the brain during development. Different cognitive functions can be described as vectors and cortical development in response to these functions can be simulated. 

The code is not yet in a shareable state, but if you would like to try the framework yourself please message me at gluzman64@gmail.com
